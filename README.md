# Hypixel Api Proxy

Simple rust web server which proxies the hypixel api. 
Implements basic caching, but thats about it.

apikey should be included in the run command, so cargo run apikeyhere

This server is somewhat built to be run on the minimum lightsail instance, which means default values are rather low. Increasing them may be worthwhile on larger servers.
